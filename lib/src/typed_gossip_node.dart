/// Extension on GossipNode to support typed events.
///
/// This extension adds type-safe methods for creating and consuming events
/// while maintaining full compatibility with the underlying gossip protocol.
/// All typed events are automatically serialized to the standard event format
/// used by the gossip library.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:gossip/gossip.dart';
/// import 'package:gossip_typed_events/gossip_typed_events.dart';
///
/// // Register event types
/// final registry = TypedEventRegistry();
/// registry.register<UserLoginEvent>(
///   'user_login',
///   (json) => UserLoginEvent.fromJson(json),
/// );
///
/// // Create typed events
/// final loginEvent = UserLoginEvent(userId: '123');
/// await node.broadcastTypedEvent(loginEvent);
///
/// // Listen for typed events
/// node.onTypedEvent<UserLoginEvent>((json) => UserLoginEvent.fromJson(json))
///     .listen((event) {
///   print('User ${event.userId} logged in');
/// });
/// ```
extension TypedGossipNode on GossipNode {
  /// Broadcasts a typed event to all peers.
  ///
  /// The typed event is automatically serialized and wrapped in the
  /// standard event payload format expected by the gossip protocol.
  /// The event will be distributed to all connected peers through
  /// the normal gossip mechanisms.
  ///
  /// The serialized format includes:
  /// - `type`: The event type identifier
  /// - `data`: The serialized event data from `toJson()`
  /// - `version`: Format version for future compatibility
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [event]: The typed event to broadcast
  ///
  /// Returns the underlying Event that was created and broadcast.
  ///
  /// Throws:
  /// - [ArgumentError] if the event is invalid
  /// - [TypedEventException] if serialization fails
  /// - Any exception from the underlying gossip node
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final orderEvent = OrderCreatedEvent(
  ///   orderId: '12345',
  ///   customerId: 'cust-456',
  ///   amount: 99.99,
  /// );
  ///
  /// final gossipEvent = await node.broadcastTypedEvent(orderEvent);
  /// print('Broadcast event with ID: ${gossipEvent.id}');
  /// ```
